TCP MSS (Maximum Segment Size) and Interface MTU (Maximum Transmission Unit)

* Data Link
 - Ethernet Max MTU: 1500 Bytes
 - Min Data Link MTU for IPv4: 68 Bytes
 - Min Data Link MTU for IPv6: 576 Bytes
 - Path MTU: the smallest MTU in the path (can be discoverd using IPv4 DF bit - ICMP error message)

* IP
 - IPv4 Header: 20 Bytes
 - IPv6 Header: 40 Bytes
 - Max Datagram Size for IPv4: 65535 Bytes (16 bits total length -> includes header)
 - Max Datagram Size for IPv6: 65575 Bytes (16 bits payload length -> dose not include header)
 - Min Reassembly Buffer Size for IPv4: 576 Bytes (UDP applications should not generate IP datagrams that exceed this size)
 - Min Reassembly Buffer Size for IPv6: 1500 Bytes

* TCP
 - Header: 20 Bytes
 - MSS for IPv4: less than or equal to MTU - 40
 - MSS for IPv6: less than or equal to MTU - 60
 - MSS(announced by the peer): less than or equal to 65535 (16 bits)
 - Default MSS for IPv4(if not announced by the peer): 576 - 40 = 536 Bytes
 - MSS option trys to avoid fragmentation

* Max Window w/o window scale option: 65535 (16 bits)

* TCP Send and Receive Buffer (Window Size)
 - Advertised TCP window size = available room in the socket receive buffer
 - TCP send and receive buffer sizes: 4096 Bytes (old), 8192 ~ 61440 Bytes (new)
 - UDP send buffer size: 9000 Bytes, UDP receive buffer size: 40000 Bytes
 - Client must set TCP receive buffer size before calling connect function
 - Server must set TCP receive buffer size before calling listen function
 - TCP socket buffer sizes should be at least three times the MSS (512 or 1460)
